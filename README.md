# 📚 Book Recommender

Welcome to the **Book Recommender** system! This project is designed to recommend books based on your preferences and interests. Whether you're looking for something similar to your favorite book or exploring new authors and genres, this system will help you discover your next great read.

## 🔍 Overview

The Book Recommender system is one of the data science projects I've been working on. It recommends books based on a prompt you provide (usually the name of a book) and various parameters such as:

- **Author**
- **Date of Publication**
- **User Reviews**

Using these factors, the system identifies books that match your interests and suggests them to you.
